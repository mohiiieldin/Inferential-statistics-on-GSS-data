## I will make a reasearch question on the data and try to answer it using data manipulation, EDA and infrential statistics that i have learned in the course.

### Data description

Since 1972, the General Social Survey (GSS) has been monitoring societal change and studying the growing complexity of American society. The GSS aims to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes; to examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups; to compare the United States to other societies in order to place American society in comparative perspective and develop cross-national models of human society; and to make high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, policy makers, and others, with minimal cost and waiting.

GSS questions cover a diverse range of issues including national spending priorities, marijuana use, crime and punishment, race relations, quality of life, confidence in institutions, and sexual behavior.

The data extract contains 57061 observations of 114 variables.

Unlike the full General Social Survey Cumulative File, the extract has been sanitized by removing missing values from the responses and factor variables were created when appropriate to facilitate analysis using R.

### Data scope  

The data sample is randomized across all united states so it can be generalized on all the adult from 18 to 89 years old but causal inference is not recommended becuase it's an observational data and causality needs experimental data.
